# Caravan catchment maps
These are a series of maps containing the locations of catchments in the Caravan dataset.<br>
The caravan dataset is a collection of streamflow and forcing data for hydrological models. <br>
Caravan was prepared by [Frederik Kratzert](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-023-01975-w), the forcing is based on the ERA5-Land model. The streamflow is from the USGS. <br>
To access it easily, it was stored [here](https://doi.org/10.4121/bf0eaf7c-f2fa-46f6-b8cd-77ad939dd350.v4) on the data.4TU.nl [OPenDAP](https://data.4tu.nl/info/about-your-data/netcdf-and-opendap) server.<br>
This saves you from downloading and reading the whole dataset hosted on [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/6578598), instead only the necesarry data is downloaded and loaded into eWaterCycle as forcing for hydrological models. 
To learn more about eWaterCycle see the [website](https://ewatercycle.org) or the [docs](https://ewatercycle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Can be viewed online [here](https://www.ewatercycle.org/caravan-map/). 

A world map with all the basins is too large to host here (~400mb), but can be generated using the code provided.
